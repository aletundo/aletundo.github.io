I have been actively involved in [teaching](#teaching) activities in both bachelor and master degree programs.

### Winter 2024: AI/ML in the Era of Climate Change (194.125)

_Lecturer, TU Wien, Austria_

The main aim of the course is to provide students with two main topics:
- how to assess and reduce the energy and environmental impact of large scale AI models;
- how to apply and leverage AI techniques to tackle critical climate change problems.

I'm in charge of developing teaching materials and delivering in person classes, designing and grading the assignments,
and finally examinating the students at the end of the course.

### Fixed-term Teaching Assistant (2017-now)

_Laboratory lecturer and tutor, University of Milano-Bicocca, Italy_

Supplementary educational activities for several B.Sc. and M.Sc. courses, mainly for the Computer Science degree.
The activities consist of holding the laboratory session, tutoring students through e-learning platforms, grading the
laboratory final projects or assignments.

Regarding course organizational aspects, I'm in charge of defining the assignments and their evaluation strategy,
the topic of the laboratory sessions and their schedule, and finally preparing the teaching material.
