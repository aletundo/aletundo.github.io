Hello, I'm happy you landed here!

I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Institute of Information Systems Engineering, Technische Universität Wien, Vienna, Austria. In particular, I'm part of the [High Performance Computing (HPC) Group](http://hpc.ec.tuwien.ac.at/).

My research interests are in the intersection of distributed systems and software architectures, with a particular focus on self-adaptivity, energy efficiency, and monitoring in the cloud continuum.

Previously, I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science with a honor mention from the University of Milano-Bicocca in 2024.
