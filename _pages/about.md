I am a **University Assistant (postdoctoral researcher)** at TU Wien (Austria) with **5+ years of industry experience as software architect and DevOps engineer**.
I'm part of the [High Performance Computing (HPC) Group](http://hpc.ec.tuwien.ac.at/)
lead by [Prof. Ivona Brandić](https://www.ec.tuwien.ac.at/~ivona/).

My research focuses on software engineering and distributed systems, with particular emphasis on the **automation of self-adaptive monitoring systems** ([TAAS 2025 pre-print](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2405.07806), [TSC 2024](https://doi.org/10.1109/TSC.2024.3349648), [ICSA-C 2024](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSA-C63560.2024.00037), [TSC 2023](https://doi.org/10.1109/TSC.2022.3180500), [SEAMS 2022](https://doi.org/10.1145/3524844.3528055), [ESEC/FSE 2019](https://doi.org/10.1145/3338906.3341185)), **fully decentralized edge computing solutions** ([TNSM 2025](https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSM.2025.3570450), [PerCom-W 2022](https://doi.org/10.1109/PerComWorkshops53856.2022.9767495), [CloudNet 2021](https://doi.org/10.1109/CloudNet53349.2021.9657141)), and **energy-aware AI-based applications** ([ASE 2023](https://doi.org/10.1109/ASE56229.2023.00046)).
In the course of my research, I have used various techniques, including but not limited to feature models, model-driven engineering, multi-objective optimization, rule-based expert systems, and gossip protocols.

I have been involved in (co-)supervision of **15+ bachelor's and master's theses**, and I recently started **co-supervising Ph.D. students**.

Previously, I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science with a honorable mention from the University of Milano-Bicocca in 2024.
