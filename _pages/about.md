I'm a University Assistant (Postdoctoral Researcher) at the Institute of Information Systems Engineering,
Technische Universität Wien, Vienna, Austria.
In particular, I'm part of the [High Performance Computing (HPC) Group](http://hpc.ec.tuwien.ac.at/)
lead by [Prof. Ivona Brandić](https://www.ec.tuwien.ac.at/~ivona/).

My research interests lie at the intersection of software engineering (SE) and distributed systems, with a particular
focus on cloud architecture monitoring, self-adaptation, and energy awareness in AI-based software systems.
In the course of my research, I have used a variety of techniques, including but not limited to feature models,
model-driven engineering, multi-objective optimization, gossip-based protocols, and rule-based expert systems.

Previously, I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science with a honorable mention from the University of Milano-Bicocca in 2024.
