I'm a University Assistant (Postdoctoral Researcher) at the Institute of Information Systems Engineering,
Technische Universität Wien, Vienna, Austria.
In particular, I'm part of the [High Performance Computing (HPC) Group](http://hpc.ec.tuwien.ac.at/)
lead by [Prof. Ivona Brandić](https://www.ec.tuwien.ac.at/~ivona/).

My research focused on software engineering (SE) and distributed systems, with particular emphasis on the automation of
self-adaptive monitoring systems (TSC 2024, ICSA-C 2024, TSC 2023, SEAMS 2022, TAAS 2025), fully decentralized edge
computing solutions (CloudNet 2021, TNSM 2025), and energy-aware AI-based applications (ASE 2023).
In the course of my research, I have used various techniques, including but not limited to feature models, model-driven
engineering, multi-objective optimization, rule-based expert systems, and gossip protocols.

Previously, I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science with a honorable mention from the University of Milano-Bicocca in 2024.
