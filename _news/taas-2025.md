Our article **A Decentralized and Self-Adaptive Approach for Monitoring Volatile Edge Environments**
has been accepted for publication in ACM Transactions on Autonomous and Adaptive Systems, Special Issue on Control for 
Computing Systems and it will be soon available. A pre-print is avilable [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07806) and the final version will be soon
available.

Kudos to my co-authors Shashikant Ilager, Jakob Fahringer, and Ivona Brandic!
